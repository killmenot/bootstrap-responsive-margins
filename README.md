# Responsive Margin & Padding Shortcuts for Twitter Bootstrap 3.0

This is an addition to Twitter Bootstrap that allows additional margin and padding shortcuts for enhanced layout control purposes. It should be included after the bootstrap.less import statement or precompiled as you see fit. It differs from bootstrap standards in that for any given screen size it predetermines the margin/padding size. All you have to do is specify the size you want xs, sm, md, lg, or xl. The exception is for items that you want to be centered using auto left/right margins. This can be device responsive by specifying mc-xs, mc-sm, mc-md, or mc-lg depending on when you want that behavior.

## Installation

```
bower install bootstrap-responsive-margins
```
